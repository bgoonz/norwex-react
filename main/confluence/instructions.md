Try to document your steps once you figure out how things work. However, do not fall into the trap of spending more time at documentation than coding.

> 1.    Create an "under construction" website and host it on a cloud provider. Does mom need to establish a domain name? It's only $12 per year, maybe less. At the end of this task we should be able to go and see Mom's site.

>2. Allow viewing of the site and logging into site with Admin rights. For the time being, admin password may be hard coded. As we progress further, it will be saved into the database. An admin user will be able to make changes to the site.

>3.  Create an "About" page where Mom will be able to add her text when she is logged in as Admin. See if you can provide her with a pallet, similar to Gmail compose or Confluence where should would be able to select a paragraph or Heading (H1 through H6), select font, style, color, etc. Look at a confluence page and try something similar. Do not worry about tables or more fancy stuff. Do allow her to embed photos and images. Allow for automatic creation of Table of Contents (for H1 - H6 headings)

>4. Create a page for Mom's videos. She should be able to upload her videos and organize them. She will probably want to organize them by product. Do not worry about actual product names. You may call them Product\_A, Product\_B, etc.

>5. The most challenging task for Phase 1 is to create a "designer page" Again, something similar to Confluence. You display a pallet with controls where a user can select text type (i.e. paragraph of heading H1 through H6), select color, italics, bold. etc. Create numbered and bullet list. Upload file or image. If image, allow the image to display.

>6.  Create an Admin page. This page should only be visible when you login as Admin. In the admin page, allow an admin to add new admins.

>7.   Create a product page. Each product should support a picture, description, and a link to a video. See if you can allow the video to play within a website in some frame.
